# Political, Economic, and Social Situation in China Since 2024

## Political Trends: Sustainability of One-Party Rule and Governance Methods

- **Concentration of Power and Opaque Personnel Changes**: Under the Xi Jinping administration, the Chinese Communist Party's governance system remains robust. Xi Jinping maintains an unusually long term in power and has continued to consolidate his authority through the dismissal of key officials in recent years. In July 2023, former Foreign Minister Qin Gang was abruptly dismissed and replaced by Wang Yi, but no official reason was provided. In the autumn of the same year, former Defense Minister Li Shangfu was also dismissed, with reports linking it to a corruption investigation, though details remain unclear. Such opaque personnel changes suggest the possibility of power struggles and are seen as signs of tension within the party's control.
    
- **Coup Rumors and Information Control**: Around 2024, multiple rumors circulated on the internet, such as "Xi Jinping suffers a stroke" and "a coup at the Beidaihe conference," fueling speculation about political instability in Zhongnanhai. These have not been officially confirmed, and authorities have suppressed the spread of misinformation through strict information control. However, the frequent emergence of such rumors is seen as a reflection of public distrust in the regime and interest in power struggles. In reality, the Chinese military and security forces have pledged allegiance to Xi Jinping, and it is believed that there are **no signs of a coup surfacing at this time**. Instead, authorities, aiming to nip any political turmoil in the bud, quickly arrange media appearances for key figures during long absences to emphasize the stability of the regime.
    
- **Strengthening Control to Maintain the System**: The Chinese government positions "national security and stability" as its top priority and maintains a firm stance of suppressing any movements that could lead to large-scale protests or challenges to the system. In the government's 2024 budget, defense spending increased by 7.2% year-on-year to 1.6655 trillion yuan, while **"stability maintenance" (维稳) related public security expenditures** were also budgeted at a substantial 227.662 billion yuan. However, the central government's published figures are only part of the national total, and some estimates suggest that the actual stability maintenance costs, including local government spending, reached a scale of **1.68 trillion yuan** (2023 estimate), potentially exceeding military spending. By investing such vast sums in security, the party-state seeks to ensure the unwavering sustainability of its rule by strengthening its surveillance and control systems.
    
- **Risk of a Tiananmen-level Crackdown and Response Tendencies**: Since the 1989 Tiananmen Square incident, the regime has shown its willingness to use military force against large-scale pro-democracy demonstrations. However, in the most recent nationwide protest, the **"White Paper Movement"** (end-of-2022 protests against zero-COVID policies), authorities, in parallel with a forceful crackdown, also adopted a flexible approach by swiftly retracting the zero-COVID policy, thereby calming the situation. When former Premier Li Keqiang passed away suddenly in October 2023, memorial gatherings occurred at some universities but were immediately dispersed by the police. Furthermore, during the Qingming Festival in April 2024, a large number of public security officials were deployed around Li Keqiang's hometown to preemptively quash spontaneous public mourning activities. From these examples, the **regime's tendency is to "nip protests in the bud at an early stage and control the situation before it escalates."** By preventing large-scale demonstrations that would require armed suppression, it avoids a Tiananmen-level crisis.
    

## Economic Trends: The State of Key Industries and Structural Issues

- **Real Estate Bubble Collapse and its Impact**: China's real estate market is in an adjustment phase after a long-term bubble, with successive defaults by developers and sales slumps becoming apparent. **Vacancies and inventory are at an all-time high**, with the officially reported unsold residential floor area reaching 648 million square meters (equivalent to about 7.2 million units) as of the end of August 2023. However, this does not include unfinished properties or vacant homes purchased for speculative purposes. Experts have presented extreme estimates that the **actual number of unused homes could be as high as "100 million units"** (equivalent to housing for about 3 billion people). A former high-ranking official from the National Bureau of Statistics also stated that "it's impossible to fill all the current vacant homes even with the entire population of 1.4 billion," acknowledging the severity of the oversupply. Urban housing prices have fallen by an average of 10-20% from their peak, with even larger drops reported in regional cities. The government has implemented measures to buy up non-performing real estate assets, but these have been criticized as insufficient in scale and funding, failing to restore market confidence. As symbolized by the "ghost towns" of new development areas and the collapse of Evergrande Group, the reality of the real estate bubble collapse has become a structural risk for the Chinese economy.
    
- **Local Government Hidden Debt Crisis**: Local governments, which have driven economic stimulus through infrastructure investment, are saddled with massive debt. Their **"hidden debt"** (implicit liabilities from Local Government Financing Vehicles, or LGFVs) is becoming a serious problem. At the end of 2023, the Chinese government approved its largest-ever measure to address the local debt problem, with a **plan to make explicit and replace 10 trillion yuan of hidden debt over the next five years**. Specifically, the special bond issuance quota will be increased by 6 trillion yuan from 2024 to 2026 (raising the local government debt ceiling to a total of 52.8 trillion yuan), which will be used to advance local refinancing and debt restructuring. Local governments will be able to allocate 800 billion yuan annually to debt repayment, and accountability for officials who engaged in reckless borrowing has also been announced. Nevertheless, the **total official local government debt reached approximately 40.7 trillion yuan at the end of 2023**. Much of the infrastructure and public works projects do not generate revenue, leaving only accumulating debt. Expert estimates suggest that the **actual local debt, including hidden debt, could be nearly double this amount**. The interest burden on local governments is straining public finances, leading to salary cuts for civil servants and cuts in public service spending in various regions. With the economic slowdown, land sale revenues have also plummeted, and local finances are on a path of deterioration. In many regions, large-scale infrastructure projects like subways and highways have become excessive or failed, leaving only debt behind. The local government debt problem has become a flashpoint that threatens the structural stability of the Chinese economy.
    
- **Overproduction in Manufacturing and Key Industries**: In China's core manufacturing sectors, **excess production capacity due to slowing demand** is prominent. For example, in the **steel industry**, domestic demand has fallen due to the real estate slump, with domestic steel consumption decreasing by 4.4% year-on-year in 2024. Although the government has instructed "zero growth in crude steel production" since 2021 for environmental targets, actual production levels have remained high. In 2024, crude steel production was 1.005 billion tons, a five-year low but still maintaining over **1 billion tons**. To compensate for sluggish domestic demand, exports have surged, reaching **110.72 million tons of steel products in 2024 (the highest level since 2015)**. This has led to backlash from manufacturers in other countries like Japan and India, claiming that "cheap Chinese steel is flooding the market, pressuring domestic industries," resulting in anti-dumping investigations and tariff hikes on Chinese steel products in various countries. Steel inventories are also piling up domestically, and it is predicted that China's crude steel production will finally enter a **decade-low reduction phase (below 1 billion tons per year) in 2025**. Similar structural problems exist in industries such as **construction materials, cement, and chemicals**, and reducing production capacity (cuts and consolidation) is a major challenge.
    
- **Emerging Industries and the Tech Sector**: In the high-tech and digital industries, **ICT and platform companies**, which temporarily faced headwinds from government regulation, have been steered back towards a growth trajectory since 2023. The Party Central Committee has expressed "support for the healthy development of the platform economy," gradually easing the crackdown on private tech companies like Alibaba and Tencent. However, facing US export restrictions on advanced semiconductors and limitations on investment in China, **technological bottlenecks in the semiconductor and AI fields** still exist. In 2023, Huawei Technologies showed movement towards domestically producing high-performance smartphone semiconductors with its own technology, but many challenges remain in mass production, and the **domestication of advanced chips is limited**. On the other hand, the **EV (Electric Vehicle) industry**, with government backing, has grown to be the largest in the world, accounting for over 60% of global production and sales. However, domestic market competition has intensified, and **overproduction and price competition**, supported by government subsidies, have become serious. In 2023, Chinese EV manufacturers engaged in significant price cuts (a "price war"), shrinking industry profit margins. Surplus production has been directed to exports, flooding European and American markets, leading to criticism of **"dumping exports."** The EU decided to impose provisional tariffs on Chinese EVs in 2024, and the US is also preparing to counter with tariff hikes. In the **tech industry as a whole**, brain drain and the impact of US-China decoupling are also concerns. There is a growing trend among highly educated youth to look overseas, with some choosing to start businesses or pursue research abroad through immigration or study programs. The government is implementing retention measures such as support for tech startups and improving the domestic research environment, but strengthening long-term innovation capabilities remains a challenge.
    
- **Table of Key Economic Indicators and Reality**: Some of China's official economic statistics are pointed out to have discrepancies with reality. Below are the officially published values of key indicators and their estimated real values based on the economic situation (the **falsification rate** is the ratio of the difference between the official value and the real value; a positive value indicates the official value is an overstatement).
    

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|**Indicator**|**Published Value (Official)**|**GPT Estimated Real Value**|**Falsification Rate (Estimate)**|
|**GDP Growth Rate (2023)**|**+5.2%**|**~+3%**|**~+40%** (Overstated)|
|**Urban Surveyed Unemployment Rate (2023 Avg.)**|**5.2%**|**~9-10%**|**~+80%** (Reality is ~2x)|
|**Youth Unemployment Rate (16-24)**|**21.3%** (June 2023)|**~30%**|**~+30%** (High-end estimate)|
|**Total Local Government Debt**|**~40.7 trillion yuan** (End of 2023)|**~80 trillion yuan** (Incl. hidden debt)|**~+100%** (Reality is 2x)|
|**Housing Price Decline Rate (from peak)**|**~-2%** (Official index)|**~-20%** (Urban avg.)|**~+90%** (Understated decline)|

_Note_: For example, the official GDP growth rate for 2023 was +5.2%, but estimates suggest the reality is around 3%, implying a suspected overstatement of about 40%. After the youth unemployment rate reached a record high of 21.3% in the summer of 2023, authorities took the unusual step of **suspending its publication**, suggesting the reality may be even higher. Furthermore, local government debt nearly doubles when unpublicized hidden debt is included. While official statistics show a modest decline in real estate prices, the market sentiment in many cities suggests a double-digit percentage drop.

## Social Trends: Diplomatic Pressure, Domestic Surveillance, and Elements of Unrest

- **Concerns of "Hostage Diplomacy"**: In recent years, Chinese authorities have been noted for their increasing use of detentions and exit bans against foreigners to protect their political interests. Since the anti-spy law was enacted in 2014, **at least 17 Japanese nationals, including expatriates from Japanese companies, have been detained on suspicion of espionage**, with five still in custody as of 2023. In March 2023, a Japanese pharmaceutical executive was detained in Beijing, leading Prime Minister Kishida to directly request his early release from President Xi Jinping. There have also been cases of Americans and Canadians being detained for long periods on national security grounds (believed to be related to espionage allegations or retaliation amid deteriorating relations with the US and Canada). While the Chinese side emphasizes that it "guarantees legitimate rights based on the rule of law," **Western countries view this as wrongful detention and express strong concern**. The U.S. State Department has issued travel advisories for China, warning of the "risk of wrongful detention and exit bans," and temporarily advised its citizens to reconsider travel in the summer of 2023 (the travel advisory level was eased after three Americans were released following a US-China agreement in September 2023). These developments have intensified criticism of China engaging in **"hostage diplomacy,"** using the detention of foreigners as a diplomatic card.
    
- **Strengthening of Citizen Surveillance**: Domestically, a **comprehensive surveillance society** utilizing big data and AI is being further enhanced. In urban areas, it is said there are **over 300 million surveillance cameras**, with tracking systems that integrate facial recognition technology and personal data (such as "Skynet" and "Sharp Eyes Project") in operation. Social media and chats are constantly censored, with authorities using AI for post detection and automatic deletion. Particularly in regions like the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and Tibet, strict surveillance systems are in place to thoroughly stamp out any seeds of ethnic or religious separatism and extremism. Furthermore, the **"Social Credit System"** is being rolled out nationwide, where the credit scores of individuals and companies are centrally managed, and low credit can lead to disadvantages such as travel restrictions and loan denials. Technologies developed during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as health codes, have been repurposed, and citizens' movement and activity histories are being digitized. Through such surveillance, which combines technology and a vast workforce, authorities are enhancing their ability to detect and suppress anti-regime movements at an early stage. The governance style that **prioritizes "maintaining stability" (维持稳定) over privacy and human rights** has become increasingly evident.
    
- **Outflow of the Wealthy and Intellectuals**: Due to domestic tightening and anxiety about the future, the desire for overseas emigration among the wealthy and highly skilled is growing. Among the affluent, diversifying assets overseas and obtaining immigrant status has become a trend, with interest in investment immigration programs in countries like Malta and Portugal surging. The overseas departure of professionals and young researchers is also increasing, with estimates suggesting that **hundreds of thousands of people emigrated from China between 2022 and 2023** (the exact number is unknown). Concerned by this, the Chinese government has **tightened the screening for new passport issuance and renewals**, at one point issuing a notice to "refrain from non-essential, non-urgent travel." Since 2023, there have been reports of procedural delays at application counters, pointing to de facto **exit control measures**. There are also cases where intellectuals have been ordered to return to China after traveling abroad, as the government scrambles to halt the brain drain. Nevertheless, having witnessed the expansion of the Hong Kong National Security Law's application to the mainland and the strengthened controls during the zero-COVID policy, the trend of the **middle class and intellectuals, who anticipate future unfreedom, seriously considering an escape from the country** continues. There is concern that if this continues, China will lose excellent human resources and capital, undermining its growth potential. In response, the government is working on retention measures such as improving the domestic business environment and creating youth employment.
    
- **Signs of Social Unrest**: Among the general populace, discontent stemming from the economic slowdown and widening inequality is smoldering. In 2023, pension and medical insurance benefits were revised in various places, leading to protests by the elderly in some cities. **In Wuhan, Hubei Province, in February 2023, tens of thousands of elderly people marched in the streets to protest medical insurance cuts, a situation where they sang "The Internationale."** Authorities deployed riot police but also announced a temporary suspension of the reforms, and the people won a certain victory (this movement was called the "White Hair Movement," referring to the white-haired generation's protest). There was also an incident in 2022 where victims of fraud at local banks in places like Hebei province held protest rallies and were suppressed by armed police. Furthermore, the **persistently high youth unemployment rate in urban areas** (over 20% even by official figures) and the resignation of competition-weary youth, known as "involution" (内卷) and "lying flat" (躺平), are pointed out as hotbeds of social unrest. On social media, complaints about job difficulties and high prices are leaked, and though they are quickly censored, these posts reveal the future anxiety of the younger generation. However, **security authorities are quick to disperse and crack down on even small-scale demonstrations and strikes**, and for now, signs of discontent developing into an organized national movement are being suppressed. Overall, while people's grievances and discontent appear sporadically, they have not led to large-scale turmoil under the powerful control system.
    

## Pharmaceutical Ingredient Supply: The Reality of China's Dependence and the Difficulty of Establishing Alternative Routes

- **China as a Production Hub for Pharmaceutical Ingredients**: China is the world's largest hub for the manufacturing of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs), and many countries depend on its supply of raw materials. According to statistics from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, as of 2019, **China accounted for about 40% of the world's API exports**, and the world relies on imports from China for major drug substances like the analgesic paracetamol. This is particularly prominent for antibiotics, where **China's export share of global antibiotic raw materials is a commanding 44.5%** (2021). In the case of the United States, it is reported that **China supplies about 90% of the active ingredients for generic drugs**. Under these circumstances, China's domestic raw material production trends and export policies are critical matters that directly affect the medical supply of various countries.
    
- **Trends in Export Controls**: To date, there have been no instances of the Chinese government imposing comprehensive export bans on pharmaceutical raw materials themselves. However, amid rising geopolitical tensions, China has strengthened export controls on strategic materials such as rare earths and semiconductor raw materials. For example, in 2023, it newly established export restrictions on gallium and germanium (semiconductor materials), and in **December 2024, it announced a hardline measure to completely ban the export of critical minerals like antimony to the United States**. This move, met with backlash from the US and Europe, brought the "weaponization of resources" to the forefront. Similarly, there are concerns that China might, in the future, prioritize its own citizens' pharmaceutical needs and **curtail the export of raw materials for antibiotics and fever reducers**. In fact, during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the Indian government temporarily banned the export of its own drug substances that were dependent on China, exposing the vulnerability of the pharmaceutical supply chain. There were also reports that China itself expanded raw material production during the pandemic and restricted supply to some other countries, raising fears that **in a crisis, nations could engage in a "tit-for-tat of export restrictions"** over pharmaceutical supplies.
    
- **Difficulty of Establishing Alternative Routes**: **It is considered extremely difficult to quickly establish alternative sources for pharmaceutical raw materials outside of China**. One reason for this is the **role of India**. India is the world's largest manufacturer of generic drugs and supplies about 50% of the generic drugs for the US market, but **nearly 80% of India's raw materials are imported from China**. This means that if China stops, supplies via India will also be disrupted. Furthermore, in Europe, the US, and Japan, many raw material factories no longer exist due to environmental regulations and profitability issues. Even if countries attempt to reshore production, the construction of new factories and the training of technicians would take several years to a decade, making it impossible to catch up in the short term. The US and EU, viewing their dependence on China for pharmaceutical procurement as a crisis, have been exploring legislative measures and subsidies to expand domestic production since 2023. Indeed, there has been movement, with major US pharmaceutical companies announcing multi-billion dollar domestic investment plans. However, experts believe that **"rebuilding the supply chain is impossible in the short term, and for the time being, it won't work without China."** National governments are increasing their stockpiles of certain medicines in preparation for emergencies, but there are limits to this. Overall, the situation where **China holds the supply of pharmaceutical raw materials is expected to continue at least in the medium term**, and the risk cannot be easily resolved as establishing alternative routes requires enormous costs and time.
    
- **Consideration of Risks and Options**: Under these circumstances, countries have several options: (1) **Expansion of stockpiles** – Secure several months to a year's worth of inventory for critical medicines during normal times to prepare for supply disruptions. (2) **Diversification of production in friendly countries** – Nurture raw material production in multiple locations such as Southeast Asia, Europe, and the US, in addition to India, to mitigate dependence on a single country. (3) **Development of alternative technologies** – Invest in innovations in raw material synthesis processes and biotechnology to enable cheaper production outside of China. (4) **International cooperation mechanisms** – Establish rules through pandemic treaties and other agreements for countries to share medicines during emergencies instead of imposing export bans. However, at present, all of these are works in progress, and **concrete measures to reduce the "China risk" are not functioning sufficiently**. Medical authorities and the pharmaceutical industry in various countries are sounding the alarm that "if China were to impose export restrictions, some medicines would immediately become scarce, and price hikes and health damage to patients would be unavoidable." As this issue pertains to both economic and national security aspects, the search for alternative routes is expected to continue in various countries.
    

## Risk Assessment of Governance Collapse, etc. (Mid-2025)

- **Governance Collapse Risk** (Risk of the current regime becoming unable to govern): **Less than 5% (Extremely Low)** – Although economic slowdown and social unrest are increasing, the organizational strength and control mechanisms of the Communist Party are robust, and the possibility of the regime becoming dysfunctional in the short term is assessed as very low.
    
- **Risk of Inability to Suppress with Force** (Risk of a large-scale turmoil that security forces cannot suppress): **~3% (Very Low)** – Due to the thoroughness of the stability maintenance system, large-scale demonstrations are unlikely to occur. Even if they do, the Chinese authorities have the capability and will to suppress them by deploying armed police and the military, so the probability of losing control is extremely small.
    
- **Communist Party Collapse Risk** (Risk of the one-party rule system itself collapsing): **~5% (Low)** – While there is an accumulation of long-term structural contradictions, there are currently no powerful alternative forces or signs of an internal coup, and the possibility of the party's rule collapsing remains low. However, it should be noted that this risk could rise in the future if an economic crisis or power struggle intensifies unexpectedly.
    

In summary, **while China currently faces a variety of challenges in its politics, economy, and society, it has not yet reached a situation of immediate systemic instability**. The Communist Party regime is utilizing all means to maintain stability, solidifying its governance system while trying to navigate the difficult situation. However, depending on economic stagnation and changes in the international environment, long-term risks may fluctuate. It is necessary to continue paying close attention to primary information and to precisely assess the future course of the situation in China.
