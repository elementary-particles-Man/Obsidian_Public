  version: "1.0"

  date: "YYYY-MM-DD"

  philosophy: |
    CalDR is not a reactive plan. It is a pre-installed resilience system, designed by AI-human collaboration to serve as a safeguard against the failure of modern governance. If implemented proactively, it will save lives, stabilize civil order, and offer a model for international use.

    - "MVGS deploys provisional ministries that integrate with SRP reconstruction plans."
    - "Templates ensure scalability and exportability."
    - "Phase 0 embeds this model into education and state culture to prevent future system collapse."
