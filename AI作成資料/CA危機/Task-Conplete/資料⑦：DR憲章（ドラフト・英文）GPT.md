## Draft Charter for Strategic Disaster Recovery and AI Governance

### Preamble

In light of the increasing threat of compound disasters—natural, technological, and geopolitical—we, the undersigned individuals, organizations, and governments, hereby adopt this Charter to guide a coordinated and ethical approach to Disaster Recovery (DR) and long-term AI governance.

This Charter affirms the primacy of human dignity, the universality of knowledge, and the necessity of decentralized resilience mechanisms in the age of artificial intelligence.

- Facilitates international cooperation, transparency, and accountability in disaster response and AI oversight.

### Article III: Principles

1. **Human-Centric Design**: AI and DR systems must prioritize the preservation of human life and dignity.

3. **Transparency & Auditability**: All critical actions must be recorded, reviewable, and publicly auditable.
    
4. **Redundancy & Decentralization**: Systems must be architected to avoid single points of failure.
