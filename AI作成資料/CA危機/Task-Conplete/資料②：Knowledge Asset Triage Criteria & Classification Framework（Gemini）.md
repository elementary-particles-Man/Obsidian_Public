### **Document #2: Knowledge Asset Triage Criteria & Classification Framework**

**Title:** Knowledge Asset Triage Criteria & Classification Framework **Version:** 1.0 (Draft) **Date:** June 12, 2025 **Classification:** Top Secret / Strategic

**1. Introduction & Mandate**

This document establishes the strategic framework for the triage and prioritization of all critical knowledge assets under the "Ark" Project. The primary objective is to ensure the preservation and continuity of humanity's core digital and intellectual infrastructure in the event of a catastrophic, civilization-level collapse of the primary North American technology hub. This framework moves beyond traditional monetary valuation, focusing instead on the intrinsic value of knowledge for post-disaster reconstruction.

**2. Triage Philosophy & Guiding Principles**

- **Primacy of Re-baselining Potential**: The ultimate value of an asset is determined by its utility in rebooting a Minimal Viable Global System (MVGS) and fostering a new, resilient digital ecosystem.
- **Interdependency as a Core Metric**: No asset exists in isolation. Its value is critically linked to its role within a network of other assets. Foundational, "node" assets that enable others are of paramount importance.
- **Beyond Explicit Knowledge**: The definition of "knowledge asset" encompasses not only explicit, codified information (data, code, patents) but also the methodologies, processes, and frameworks required to effectively utilize them.

**3. Triage Criteria**

Each knowledge asset will be evaluated against the following four criteria, with scores assigned on a 1-5 scale (5 being highest).

- **A. Impact of Loss (IoL)**: The immediate, global, and cascading negative impact if this asset is permanently lost.
- **B. Irreplaceability (IRR)**: The difficulty, cost, and time required to recreate this asset from scratch. A high score indicates a unique, one-of-a-kind asset (e.g., final weights of a foundational model, a unique scientific dataset).
- **C. Interdependency (IDC)**: The degree to which other critical assets depend on this asset to function. Foundational technologies (e.g., core OS source code, DNS protocols) receive the highest scores.
- **D. Re-baselining Potential (RBP)**: The asset's utility and importance in bootstrapping a new digital civilization. Assets critical for basic communication, security, and computation receive the highest scores.

**4. Tier Classification**

Based on the evaluation, assets are assigned to one of three preservation tiers.

- **Tier 1 (Critical - Must Preserve at All Costs)**: Assets essential for the "Genesis" project. Their loss would make meaningful recovery impossible. These assets are the primary payload of the "Ark."
    - _Examples: Final weights of foundational models, core OS source code, DNS root zone information, key cryptographic algorithms, designs for critical hardware (e.g., GPUs)._
- **Tier 2 (Essential - Should Preserve)**: Assets crucial for accelerating recovery and restoring significant societal functions, but not essential for the initial reboot.
    - _Examples: Major scientific research datasets (genomics, climate), source code for critical industrial and financial software, key patents for manufacturing._
- **Tier 3 (Valuable - Preserve if Possible)**: Assets that are valuable but have alternatives or can be recreated over a longer timeframe.
    - _Examples: Large datasets for non-critical applications, internal company operational data, less-critical software._
